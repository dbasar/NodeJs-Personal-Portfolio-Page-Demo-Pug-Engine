# NodeJS-Personal-Portfolio-Page-Demo

By Doruk Ba≈üar. <br>
<br>
This is the demo of the personal webpage I had created for my spouse using Node.js. <br>
The project uses static CSS and JS files from the public folder, creates HTML files using pug template engine and loads them according to the provided url. <br>
In order to make the site include both English and Turkish pages, I've created the English and Turkish text in two seperate text module folders and have the template engine draw the corresponding text from them. The language choice is stored in a cookie and used in ensuing requests. <br>
<br>
The exact design is also used in a static page (in Turkish language) that I've created and put in this repository: <br>

<br>
This project is the continuation of another project that I've made using static HTML files, which is provided it on this repository: <br>

<br>
To be able to view the project, you need to do the following: <br>
1- Install node.js. <br>
2- Open a terminal and navigate to where the app.js file is located. <br>
3- Type "node app" in the terminal. <br>
4- Go to "http://localhost:5000" using your browser. <br>
